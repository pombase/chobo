=head1 Current problems

=over

=item * Some OBO files aren't supported because not all edge cases are handled

=item * Uses a lot of memory (500MB to read and store GO)

=item * Currently ignores stanza tags that PomBase doesn't use (eg. "xref:")

=item * The destination Chado database must contain:

=over

=item * an is_a relation

=item * a CV named "synonym_type" containing all synonym types from the input OBO files

=item * a CV named "cv_property_type" containing a term named "cv_version"

=back

An example Chado DB containing these is here:
L<https://github.com/pombase/pombase-legacy/blob/master/pombase-chado-base.dump?raw=true>

=item * Ontologies can't be re-loaded
